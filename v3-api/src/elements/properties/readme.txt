// we define some link types here:


1] plain undirected link


2] directed Link (having arrowTail and arrowHead rendering Element


3] N-p-N link << where p can be used again by the force as the node for optiomization
   // here we have to optimize stuff, using some datastruct magic
   // >> idea have more than one link use forceLink, have one link use direct N-P-N linkage
